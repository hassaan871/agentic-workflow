In contrast, Trans\u2011Saharan trade centered on bulk, high\u2011value commodities like gold, salt, and slaves; the exchange of salt for gold created a mutually dependent economic system that reinforced the wealth of desert kingdoms and supported large caravansary networks.\n\n- **Economic Impact:** The Silk Road spurred the growth of cosmopolitan cities, fostered sophisticated banking and credit practices, and integrated distant economies into a broader commercial network. Trans\u2011Saharan trade, while similarly driving urban prosperity in West African empires (e.g., Mali, Songhai), emphasized the circulation of essential resources that underpinned state revenues and the development of trade hubs like Timbuktu and Gao.\n\n---\n\n**Key Trans\u2011Saharan Commodities**  \nGold  \nSalt  \nIvory"", ""attempt_2"": ""**Economic Effects of the Trans\u2011Saharan Trade Routes vs. the Silk Road**\n\n| Aspect | Trans\u2011Saharan Trade Routes | Silk Road |\n|--------|----------------------------|-----------|\n| Primary Economic Impact | Stimulated the rise of powerful West African empires (e.g., Ghana, Mali, Songhai) by providing tax revenue and access to exotic goods; facilitated the spread of Islam and centralized political authority in the Sahel. | Enabled long\u2011distance exchange that enriched Chinese, Indian, Persian, and Mediterranean societies; spurred urban growth along the route (e.g., Chang\u2019an, Samarkand, Constantinople) and the development of guilds and merchant capitals. |\n| Core Goods Traded | Gold and salt (the \u201cgold\u2011salt\u201d axis); ivory, slaves, kola nuts, and later, copper and textiles.
